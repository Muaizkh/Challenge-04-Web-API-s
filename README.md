# Challenge-04-Web-API's

## Description
A coding challenge quiz created for the purpose of testing the abilities that have been taught so far in the class. The motivation for creating this was to get a better understanding of coding as well as how to implment many different styles and skills and functions into HTML through JavaScript. I was able to experience things and issues that very much allowed me to grow more as a coder and with continuious repetition I feel I will be able to create this even faster and better.
